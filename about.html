              <h1>It was fate...</h1>
              <p>Nick and Kristen met in January of 2005 as freshman at Penn State, right after Nick transferred from Georgia Tech. Kristen's friend, Erika, had been telling her about a friend from high school that was transferring to PSU that she wanted everyone to meet since he was new to campus. Ironically enough, Nick and Kristen were in the same calculus class. At class introductions on the first day, Kristen recognized the "from Long Island and transferred from Georgia Tech" story. They started hanging out as friends and one Thursday evening, Nick called it an early night of partying with his fraternity brothers to do some calculus homework with Kristen. Kristen knew then that they would turn out to be more than friends in time.</p>

              <h1>Where we are now</h1>
              <p>After dating for three years in college, Nick moved to California to be with Kristen where she moved after graduating from Penn State. They lived the SoCal life for two years, moved to Pennsylvania for a year while Kristen worked for Gatorade, and then finally made their way back to NY in November 2012 to be closer to family and friends. Within three weeks of moving to NY, Nick "finally" proposed. According to Nick, they're now in the best place on earth (a.k.a. NY), along with their dog Cocoa, where they hope to spend their married life together. Keep an eye out for Cocoa at the wedding, he is going to make a cameo appearance!</p>

              <h1>The Proposal</h1>
              <p>Nick did an AMAZING job with the proposal! Kristen and Nick were at Penn State for a football weekend with some friends from college. The Friday night we got to Happy Valley, Nick brought Kristen to the classroom they met in, where they took calculus together almost eight years prior. Nick quickly got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. She instantly said yes and then they went downtown to meet up with their friends and celebrate the good news!</p>
