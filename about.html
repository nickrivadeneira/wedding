              <h1>It was fate...</h1>
              <p>Nick and Kristen met in January of 2005 as freshman at Penn State, right after Nick transferred from Georgia Tech. Kristen's friend, Erika, had been telling her about a guy that she went to high school with that she wanted everyone to meet. Ironically enough, Nick and Kristen happened to be in the same calculus class. They started hanging out as friends, both in and out of class. One Thursday night, Nick called it an early night of partying with his fraternity brothers to do some calculus homework with Kristen. Who stops partying for homework?! Kristen knew then that they might turn out as more than friends in time.</p>

              <h1>Where we are now</h1>
              <p>After dating for three years in college, Nick moved to California to be with Kristen while she was working full time for Pepsi. They lived the SoCal life for two years, moved to Pennsylvania for a year while Kristen worked for Gatorade, and then finally made their way back to NY in November 2012 to be with family and friends. Within three weeks of moving to NY, Nick "finally" proposed. According to Nick, they're now in "the best place on earth", where they hope to spend their married life together.</p>

              <h1>The Proposal</h1>
              <p>Nick did an AMAZING job with the proposal! Kristen and Nick were at Penn State for a football weekend with some friends from college. The Friday night we got to Happy Valley, Nick brought Kristen to the classroom they met in, where they took calculus together almost eight years prior. Nick quickly got down on one knee and asked if she would "make more memories with him." She instantly said yes and then went downtown to see their friends and celebrate the good news!</p>
