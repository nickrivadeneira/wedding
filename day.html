              <h1>Saturday, May 3rd 2014</h1>
              <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be held at historic Alder Manor in Yonkers, NY. With a romantic and relaxed vibe, Kristen and Nick fell in love with this venue to celebrate their big day. We hope you all love the beautiful architecture and charm of this 1912 estate along the Hudson River as much as we do.</p>
