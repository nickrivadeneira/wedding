              <h1>Saturday, May 3rd 2014</h1>
              <p>Both the ceremony and reception will be held at historic Alder Manor in Yonkers, NY. The ceremony is scheduled to commence outdoors at 5 P.M., in the garden of the Manor (we are hoping for a beautiful Spring day!) With a romantic and relaxed vibe, Kristen and Nick fell in love with this venue, hoping our guests would simply take it easy, have a drink, and help us celebrate! We hope you all love the beautiful architecture and charm of this 1912 estate along the Hudson River as much as we do.</p>
