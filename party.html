                  Kristen met Nicole at Cloonan Middle School when the Vahsen's moved to Connecticut in 1998. They quickly became friends and have been close ever since. When we were younger, we thought being friends for 3 or 4 years was such a long time-- now we've been best friends for 15 years and she is going to be my maid of honor! Nicole is always there when I need her; I am so lucky to have someone that knows me so well, be right by my side for the wedding.

                  Katherine is Kristen's younger sister; currently a sophomore at Westhill High School. Our relationship has evolved quite a bit over time- I used to take care of Katherine when she was a baby, and now we now swap tips on hair and makeup while shopping the afternoon away. Katherine is a very loving sister to both Nick and I, and we look forward to taking lots of pictures with her on our big day!

                  Nerissa is Nick's sister and my future sister-in-law! She is always the first person to step forward and lend a helping hand when you need it and is someone you can really count on. Nerissa is extremely creative, and having gotten married last Fall, has been so helpful with the wedding planning already! We have Nerissa to thank for finding our venue that we love so much.

                  Kim is Kristen's sorority sister and roommate from Penn State, having lived together both Junior and Senior year of college. Kim introduced me to all of the wedding shows on TLC that we admittedly watched way too much of together in between classes. Kim has always been a great friend to hang out with any time and I know will help keep me calm on the big day.

                  <h4 class="media-header">Jessica Sclafani - <small class="muted">Bridesmaid</small></h4>
                  Kristen met Jessica at her first job, where they were cashiers together at Giovanni's Market in Stamford. We always have the greatest catch up sessions, as we've only been able to see each other every few months after I graduated high school. Jessica is probably the sweetest and most sentimental person I know. She'll be the one telling me it's ok for me to cry on my wedding day and she'll be right there with me.

                  Kristen also met Sarah at Giovanni's Market, where they also worked together for three years. When Kristen, Sarah and Jessica were assigned to work together, it was more social hour than work. Sarah is very outgoing and is always inspiring me to try new things- sometimes, it's as simple as sporting a bold piece of jewelry! Sarah is also hysterical and simply so much fun- I know her company for the wedding will be no different.
